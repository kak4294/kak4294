# Hi there, I'm Kyle Krebs 👋

**Software Engineer | Sports Analytics Enthusiast**

I'm a Computer Science student at RIT passionate about making better decisions... which I firmly believe that starts with unbiased data. I love building full-stack applications that bring data to life. Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at MicroEra Power, where I develop IoT monitoring systems and real-time data visualization tools.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- As the longest tenured software engineer at **MicroEra Power**, I've helped lead a team taking on multiple full-stack development projects. Building thermal-energy-storage monitoring systems using Python, Flask, React, and Raspberry Pi's for the hardware interface.
- Founding and leading RIT's **Basketball Analytics Club** (40+ members)
- Leading the **Liberty League Basketball Analytics Project** where I built a comprehensive scraper and database system. Using this play-by-play data from all Division I, II, and III basketball games, my club and I are developing a Monte Carlo simulation to predict game scores. The model's insights help coaches understand which play types maximize their winning potential.  
- Building interactive Tableau dashboards and scouting reports for basketball coaches.

## 🏀 Unique Background

I'm a former Division III basketball player who grew a passion for data analytics. I combine my basketball experience with technical skills to help build analytical solutions & teach new members about the beautiful game of basketball. As founder of RIT's Basketball Analytics Club, I've found an incredible team of e-board members. We all work together to manage the club and help students apply data science concepts to real basketball scenarios. We work heavily with both our men's & women's basketball teams at RIT.
