# Hi there, I'm Kyle Krebs 👋

**Software Engineer | Sports Analytics Enthusiast**

I'm a Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology with a passion for using data to help people make better decisions. I've enjoyed building full-stack applications currently working as a Software Engineer at MicroEra Power. It was here I developed IoT monitoring systems and real-time data visualization tools.

## 🔭 What I'm Working On

- As the longest tenured software engineer at **MicroEra Power**, I've helped lead a team taking on multiple full-stack development projects. Building thermal-energy-storage monitoring systems using Python, Flask, React, and Raspberry Pi's for the hardware interface.
- Founding and leading RIT's **Basketball Analytics Club** (40+ members)
- After building the scraper and database for the **Liberty League Basketball Analytics Project**. My club and I are using the play-by-play data from all Division I, II, and III basketball games to build a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the scores of basketball games. Interpretation of the model will help coaches better understand what types of plays they should run to give them a better chance at winning.  
- Building interactive Tableau dashboards and scouting reports for basketball coaches.
